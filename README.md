### Home Fire Detection System Using LLM Agents

This project, **Home Fire Detection System Using LLM Agents**, leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning techniques to assist in the early detection of fires in residential environments. The system processes data inputs, such as text descriptions or images, and provides intelligent analysis to detect and alert users of potential fire hazards. This innovative approach prioritizes safety by enabling rapid identification of threats and effective communication with homeowners or monitoring systems.

#### Key Features:
- **Fire Detection via Text and Images**: The system accepts textual descriptions or images of environments and uses LLMs to analyze the data for fire-related indicators.
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: LLM agents interpret environmental cues and contextual information to identify potential risks.
- **Enhanced Safety Monitoring**: Provides a proactive method to alert users about fire hazards, reducing the risk of property damage and personal injury.
- **RAG-Based Architecture**: Employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to ensure context-aware analysis of data inputs, enhancing the accuracy of fire detection.

#### Use Case:
The project is designed to assist homeowners, safety monitoring agencies, or smart home systems in identifying fire risks early by providing detailed analysis and actionable insights. It can integrate seamlessly into existing safety infrastructure or be used as a standalone system for enhanced fire detection capabilities.
